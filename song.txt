I loved you: there may be love inside me still,
The love within my soul has not completely frayed,
But this love can no longer be cause for your ill;
I cannot be the poison that leaves your joy decayed.
I cannot be the poison that leaves your joy decayed.

I loved you silently, beyond will, 
And in this shy, jealous love, we began to fade
But it was a love written tenderly, with truth’s quill
May God render you again love’s sweet maid.
